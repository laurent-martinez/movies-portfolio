## About the App

This is a `Next.js` app built with `TypeScript`,
that utilizes `the Movie Database API` to fetch data.
The app also uses `Tailwind CSS` for styling,
`React icons` and `emojis` for additional visual elements,
and `Framer-Motion` for animations. Additionally,
the code is formatted using the `eslint-config-airbnb` package.
